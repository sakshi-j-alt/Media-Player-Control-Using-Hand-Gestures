# Media-Player-Control-Using-Hand-Gestures
I created this project using OpenCV, implementing computer vision algorithms from cv2, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI libraries. 
The project focuses on detecting and interpreting hand gestures, allowing seamless control of media players through elongated finger movements. With this system, you can control videos, PowerPoint presentations, and music applications.
